# Two modes, insert and normal
- Vim has two basic modes. One is insert mode, in which you write text as if in normal text editor.
- Another is normal mode which provides you efficient ways to navigate and manipulate text.
- At any time, you can see which mode you are in on the status bar which is located at the top of the editor.

- Good, now you're in insert mode. Write something and change back to normal mode.
- Good. Let's move on to another section.
