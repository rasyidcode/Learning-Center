# Deleting, d
- d is the delete command
- You can combie it with movement, e.g. dw deletes the first word on the right side of the cursor
- It also copies the content, so that you can paste it with p to another location (on real Vim).
- The word is gone. Now let's remove two words with d2e.
- TO 'de' or not to 'de', is not the question, anymore.
